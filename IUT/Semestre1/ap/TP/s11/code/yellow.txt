In the city where I was born
To live a man that sailed to sea
And it told us its life
In the ground of submarines
If we sailed until the sun
To find the sea of green
And we lived below waves
In our yellow submarine
We whole living in our yellow submarine
Yellow yellow submarine submarine
We whole living in our yellow submarine
Yellow yellow submarine submarine
And our friends are all on board
Far more of live them the door next
And the band begins to amuse themselves
We whole living in our yellow submarine
Yellow yellow submarine submarine
We whole living in our yellow submarine
Yellow yellow submarine submarine
As we live a life of affluence
Whole the world of us has all we need
The sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine
